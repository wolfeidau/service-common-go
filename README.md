# service-common-go

This is some common service code I use across a range of different projects so I have centralised them in one place.

# Overview

* logger - Some functions which create sane default logger using [github.com/rs/zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog).
* templates - Some code which helps setup and use templates with [echo](https://github.com/labstack/echo/v4).
* flags - The default base flags I use in a lot of service projects which are powered by [kong](github.com/alecthomas/kong).
